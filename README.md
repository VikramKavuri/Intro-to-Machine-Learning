# Intro-to-Machine-Learning
This project is centered around the application of custom linear and logistic regression models to a diverse range of datasets. Notably, it does not rely on pre-built models provided by the scikit-learn library or other external sources. Instead, the project involves the development of these regression models from the ground up. The primary aim is to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies involved in the functioning of these models.

Linear regression, a fundamental technique in statistics and machine learning, is implemented without resorting to the use of readily available models, allowing for complete customization and fine-tuning to suit the specific characteristics of each dataset. Similarly, logistic regression, commonly employed in classification tasks, is also constructed from scratch.

By adopting this approach, the project emphasizes the importance of hands-on experience in building and refining regression models. Through this process, the project aims to provide a detailed exploration of the underlying mathematics, optimization techniques, and model evaluation methods, offering a valuable educational resource for those seeking a deeper understanding of regression analysis.
